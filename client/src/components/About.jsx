          Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ My name is Maria Hirai. I am a full stack engineer with the experience in Javascript, React, Node.js, Express.js, RDBMS, Postgresql, MongoDB and Cloud Infrastructure. I have previously worked at Oracle as an IT consultant, dealing with various cloud infrastructures and systems of clients all over Japan. I enjoyed learning so many new technology throughout my years there, and has reinforced my passion in technology, specifically in coding.

          I recently graduated from Hack Reactor, a 1000+ hour bootcamp that is highly intensive and requires efficient and quick learning. One of the projects I&apos;ve worked on is creating a full stack application that helps dog owners find like-minded dogs. I truly enjoy the process of building web applications both front-end and back-end, including numerous problem solving and debugging!
