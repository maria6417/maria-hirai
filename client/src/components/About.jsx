            Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ My name is Maria Hirai and I am a passionate software engineer that loves creating modern UI applications and exceptional user experience. I have previously worked at Oracle as a technical consultant, dealing with various cloud infrastructures and systems of clients all over Japan. I enjoyed learning so many new technology throughout my years there, and has reinforced my passion in technology, specifically in coding.
          </p>

          <p>
            I recently graduated from Hack Reactor, a 1000+ hour bootcamp that is highly intensive and requires efficient and quick learning. One of the projects I&apos;ve worked on is creating a full stack application that helps dog owners find like-minded dogs. I truly enjoy the process of building web applications and exceptional user experience, numerous problem solving, and debugging!

          <div>
            Some of the technologies that I use day-to-day are:
            <Grid>
              {techStack.map((stack) => (
                <li style={{ display: 'flex', padding: '5px 0' }}>
                  <BulletPoint size="20px" src={arrow} alt="arrow" />
                  {`  ${stack}`}
                </li>
              ))}
            </Grid>
          </div>
        </Desc>
      </FlexRow>
    </Section>
  );
}

const ProfilePic = styled.img`
  width: 300px;
  height: 300px;

const FlexRow = styled.div`
  display: flex;
